This page chronicles the redesign for my portfolio website.

I wanted to redesign the site because it was difficult to maintain a portfolio site that was crafted entirely from raw HTML and CSS.

However, I still wanted to have the freedom of creating a personal website that I could call my own. I wanted to have the satisfaction of sitting down and coding something that was a part of me, just as my original portfolio site had been.
